Pico RSS Plugin
===============

Provides an RSS Feed for Pico. It will only include content with a "Date" field.

Install
-------

1. Extract download an copy the "pico_rss" folder to your Pico install "plugins" folder
2. Visit http://www.yoursite.com/feed
3. Thats it :)

**Note**

This is a fork from the original plugin at https://github.com/gilbitron/Pico-RSS-Plugin
It didn't work well for me with Pico2.0 (it produced a feed with only the same few 
first posts) so I did some tweaks to make it work correctly for me (displays the 
last 20 posts). But I'm not fully sure why the original one wouldn't work, so your
mileage might vary...
